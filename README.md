just a really easy way for me to setup a raspberry pi really quickly<br>
plz lmk if a script isn't compatible with a device

| file | description | devices |
| - | - | - |
| proxy.sh | socks5 proxy on port 1080 | all |
| fan.sh | keep the pi 5 fan always on | RPi 5 |
| minecraft.sh | latest version minecraft spigot server | 64-bit Pi |
| prometheus-amd64.sh | prometheus monitoring for amd64 devices | idk but def not the Pi |
